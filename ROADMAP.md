# Project Roadmap

This document outlines the future development plans for the RP2040 DCC Locomotive Decoder.

## Version 1.0 (MVP)

*   [ ] Basic DCC packet parsing
*   [ ] BEMF-based motor control (speed and direction)
*   [ ] Single function output (headlight)
*   [ ] Hardcoded DCC address
*   [ ] Basic documentation

## Version 1.1

*   [ ] RailCom support (channel 2)
    *   Broadcast decoder address
    *   Broadcast speed and direction
*   [ ] Configurable DCC address via CVs
*   [ ] Additional function outputs

## Version 1.2

*   [ ] Advanced motor control
    *   PID control for smoother operation
    *   Configurable motor control CVs (e.g., start voltage, acceleration)
*   [ ] Support for more function types (e.g., blinking lights, strobes)

## Version 2.0

*   [ ] Sound support
    *   Basic sound playback (e.g., horn, bell)
    *   Support for sound fonts
*   [ ] LCC/Layout Command Control integration

## Future Ideas

*   [ ] Support for other motor types
*   [ ] Wireless control (e.g., Wi-Fi, Bluetooth)
*   [ ] Advanced sound features (e.g., dynamic sounds, multiple sound fonts)
