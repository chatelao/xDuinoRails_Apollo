### 1. General

#### 1.1 Purpose of the Standard

Many command stations support multiple protocols and transmit them interleaved in time. Every decoder in such a multi-protocol environment should exhibit clear, predictable behavior. This is especially true if it supports several of the protocols sent by the command station.

Furthermore, the transition to an analog operating mode (i.e., one not controlled by a digital protocol) must follow fixed rules. This section is a significantly expanded version of the corresponding section in [S-9.2.4] of the NMRA.

This standard specifies how a decoder selects its operating mode. Within this standard, the term "operating mode" includes all digital protocols and analog modes of a decoder.

This standard does not define the conditions for detecting a protocol, how a decoder is addressed within a protocol, or how to switch between different modes within a protocol (e.g., operating mode and programming mode). These specifications are defined in the standards for the respective protocols.

#### 1.2 Requirements for Decoders

Every decoder must meet all the following requirements. Exceptions are indicated by "should" or "can".

A decoder may support multiple protocols and analog operating modes. It is permissible to configure a different address for each protocol.

For protocols with block-based addressing, such as Selectrix, it cannot be reliably determined whether the decoder has been addressed. Therefore, priorities for the supported protocols and operating modes are necessary, which must be clearly described in the manual.

Supported protocols and operating modes can be disabled through configuration. For the DCC protocol, CV 12 as defined in [RCN-225] is provided for this purpose. If a protocol or operating mode is disabled, a decoder must not react to this protocol or switch to this mode, regardless of the following specifications. However, if a disabled but supported digital protocol is detected, the decoder must not switch to an analog operating mode.

An exception is made for packets of the programming modes, which may be processed even if the associated protocol is disabled. This is necessary because not all protocols provide the configuration options to re-enable the respective protocol.

#### 1.3 Requirements for Command Stations

Every command station must meet all the following requirements. Exceptions are indicated by "should" or "can".

### 2. Defining the Protocol for Accessory Decoders

An accessory decoder must always react to all enabled protocols on all configured addresses.

The problem with a fixed protocol selection is that accessory decoders are not addressed regularly. Therefore, no selection is generally provided; instead, they always react to all enabled protocols.

### 3. Power-on Behavior of Vehicle Decoders

When decoders receive power, there are two possibilities:

1.  The powerless state was brief, so the decoder still has valid information about speed, direction, and the last operating mode. In this case, it may immediately resume the previous operation. If the protocol on the track has changed, it must treat this change as if there had been no interruption of the power supply.
2.  The decoder no longer has complete information about the previous operating state. In this case, the decoder must comply with the corresponding specifications in [RCN-530] and for the DCC programming mode [RCN-216].

If the decoder stores its operating state in non-volatile memory, so that it knows its old state even after a long time, it must have another mechanism to detect longer power outages and must not use the old operating state afterward.

### 4. Digital Operating Modes of Vehicle Decoders

#### 4.1 Protocol Detection

For protocol detection, the following standards must be observed, depending on the supported protocols: For DCC [RCN-210], [RCN-211], and [RCN-216] for the programming mode, and once defined, for mfx® [RCN-245], for Märklin Motorola [RCN-265], and for Selectrix [RCN-275]. When detecting a protocol, the correctness of the checksum does not need to be checked.

#### 4.2 Protocol Selection at Startup

If only one protocol is enabled, the decoder reacts only to this protocol and immediately switches to this operating mode upon detecting the protocol. This applies in particular to the Selectrix protocol, where the decoder would otherwise have to wait to see if it is addressed in another way.

If more than one protocol is enabled and a preferred protocol is configured, it should always select this protocol as soon as it detects it, regardless of whether it is addressed via this protocol.

If the preferred protocol is not detected within a time specified by the manufacturer or user, the decoder must behave as if no preferred protocol was set.

If no preferred protocol is set, it should react to the protocol through which it is first addressed. An exception is the Selectrix protocol, as all available 112 addresses are always addressed. The decoder should only select the Selectrix protocol if it is not addressed by another enabled protocol for at least 10 seconds.

As long as it is not addressed by any protocol, the decoder must not activate any output and must not turn on the motor.

#### 4.3 Protocol Selection During Operation

A decoder may only switch from the selected protocol to another protocol if it has not been addressed via the selected protocol for a time specified by the manufacturer or user, or if the selected protocol is no longer detected. In this case, the selection of the operating mode is made as after the power is applied. The manufacturer can define the time to be arbitrarily short to allow a spontaneous switch between protocols. This must be clearly described in the manual.

#### 4.4 Multiple Addresses

If a decoder can react to multiple addresses of one protocol, there must be priorities or assignments for this. Separate specifications can be defined for each function (motor, function outputs, sounds, etc.) of the decoder. A single function of a decoder may only be controlled by one address at a time. The same rules apply to switching between addresses as for selecting the protocol.

An example of assigning functions to addresses is the advanced consisting in the DCC protocol. Drive commands are received exclusively on the consist address, function commands may be configurable to be received via the base or consist address, and configuration commands are generally only received via the base address.

### 5. Analog Operating Modes

If a decoder supports an analog operating mode, it must be possible to disable it via configuration.

The selection of an analog operating mode may only occur if none of the supported protocols are detected. In addition, either:

*   a DC voltage without polarity change must be detected for at least 200 ms – or the "Maximum time without data reception" set via CV 11 – or
*   an AC voltage with polarity changes every 7 to 12 ms must be detected.

If these requirements were met and the decoder is in an analog operating mode, it may only activate functions that are enabled in CVs 13 and 14 (see [RCN-225]) and other manufacturer-specific CVs for functions above F12, if DCC is supported. This setting may also be used for other protocols.

In analog mode, the decoder must immediately exit the analog mode upon detecting a protocol supported by the decoder. This also applies if the protocol is supported by the decoder but is not enabled.

If neither a supported and enabled protocol nor one of the mentioned analog voltage forms is detected, the decoder must switch off all consumers connected to it.

### 6. Transitions Between Operating Modes

In principle, sharp speed jumps and spontaneous changes of direction should be avoided when changing the operating mode. For this purpose, the following rules are established.

If the decoder switches to another digital operating mode, it must maintain the previous speed, direction, and function status until it receives corresponding commands in the new operating mode.

If the direction of travel specified by the new operating mode matches the previous one when changing the operating mode (including a change of protocol), the decoder must adjust the speed with the acceleration or braking delay configured for the new operating mode – in analog mode, as far as possible given the available voltage.

If the direction of travel specified by the new operating mode does not match the previous one when changing the operating mode (including a change of protocol), the speed is determined by the new operating mode, but the decoder must maintain the previous direction of travel until the vehicle comes to a stop either through a corresponding command in digital mode or by lowering the voltage in analog mode. Afterward, it must again observe the direction information of the new operating mode. Otherwise, the behavior specified for a matching direction of travel applies.

### 7. Multi-protocol Operation of Command Stations

The command station must ensure that all specifications for all transmitted protocols are always met. This particularly affects the minimum repetition rates. This may limit the number of protocols that can be sent simultaneously.

A vehicle address may only be addressed via one protocol at a time. An exception is the Selectrix protocol, where addresses cannot be addressed individually. Here, it is the decoder's responsibility to select the protocol according to section 4.

Each active vehicle address must be addressed at least every 2.5 seconds. A vehicle address is considered active if the speed is not 0 or if the status in the command station is kept active for other reasons.

If commands for a programming mode are generated, only commands of this protocol may be sent. For example, if the DCC programming mode is initiated with DCC reset packets, no other protocols may be sent until the programming is complete. Commands for programming on the main track are not affected by this rule, i.e., they may also be sent in a multi-protocol environment.

Accessory decoders always react to all enabled protocols. Therefore, each accessory decoder address should only be addressed in one protocol to avoid interference.
